## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
In this article, I will be analyzing different aspects of Airbnb listings in New York. I will be working with the dateset that is available on Inside Airbnb up to July 7, 2020.

I will be looking into the following questions:
- How does the price distribution in New York look like?
- What are the different room types available and how does their price differ?
- How does the area or neighborhood affect the price?
- Does the “minimum night” requirement affect the price?
- How does the demand fluctuate for AirBnb in New York with regards to weeks of the year?
- Is there a certain season where demand for housing increase?

## Getting Started <a name="par1"></a>

This project uses the following libraries:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

In order to get a local copy of the project, you will need to download the dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html),
and add it to the same folder of the project. 
The dataset has two files and both are used in the project:
- listings.csv
- reviews.csv

Download the [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook from this repository and have fun!
